#Create a new script in your r-davis-in-class-yourname project named week_4_assignment_ABC.R but with your initials in place of ABC. Save it to your scripts folder.

#Read portal_data_joined.csv into R using the read.csv command and create a dataframe named surveys (just like we did in class).

surveys <- read.csv(file = "Data/portal_data_joined.csv")

#Subset to just the first column and columns five through 8. Include only the first 400 rows. Save this as a dataframe called surveys_subset.

surveys_subset <- surveys[1:400,c(1,5:8)]

#CHALLENGE: Select all rows that have a hindfoot_length greater than 32, save these in a new data.frame named surveys_long_feet, then plot its hindfoot_length values as a histogram using the hist function.

surveys_long_feet <- surveys_subset[surveys_subset$hindfoot_length > 32,]

hist(surveys_long_feet$hindfoot_length)

#Change the column hindfoot_lengths into a character vector.

as.character(surveys_long_feet$hindfoot_length)

#Plot the hindfoot_lengths in a histogram (if this doesnâ€™t work, just leave it, and think about it during Part II of the assignment, wink wink).

hist(surveys_long_feet$hindfoot_length)

#Commit & Push the R script to GitHub - check your repository on GitHub and make sure your script is there.
